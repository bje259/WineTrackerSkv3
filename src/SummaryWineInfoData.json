    "Facts_wine_desc": "Bordeaux has a cool marine coastal climate, with mild weather and no dry season. Bordeaux reds tend to be lower in alcohol and are slightly lighter in body.\n\nStylistically, they exhibit more nuanced flavors and less up-front fruit. Sophisticated and elegant, they pair well with game meats, roast lamb, or hearty beef stews.\n\nBordeaux is the largest wine producing region in France. It consists of two major areas—the Left and the Right Bank. Both lie in the heart of the Gironde estuary and are further divided by its tributaries, the Garonne and the Dordogne rivers.\n\nWhile the Right Bank produces blends that are mostly Merlot dominant, the Left Bank produces blends that are primarily Cabernet Sauvignon dominant.\n\nBordeaux reds are said to be terroir-driven (if you like French wines, you'll hear this term a lot). Terroir is a concise way to define a specific region based upon the soil, climate, and the collective knowledge of the generations of people who have farmed the land.\n\nWhen shopping for Bordeaux reds, keep in mind, French wines are all about the region and the blend, not about individual grape varieties. In fact, you will rarely find blend percentages listed on the label.\n\nCollectively, Bordeaux produces 700 million bottles of wine in an average year! While some of the most expensive wines in the world come from Bordeaux, most are every day, affordable table wines.",

Bordeaux reds tend to be lower in alcohol and are slightly lighter in body.\n\nStylistically, they exhibit more nuanced flavors and less up-front fruit. Sophisticated and elegant, they pair well with game meats, roast lamb, or hearty beef stews.\n\nBordeaux is the largest wine producing region in France. It consists of two major areas—the Left and the Right Bank. Both lie in the heart of the Gironde estuary and are further divided by its tributaries, the Garonne and the Dordogne rivers.\n\nWhile the Right Bank produces blends that are mostly Merlot dominant, the Left Bank produces blends that are primarily Cabernet Sauvignon dominant.\n\nBordeaux reds are said to be terroir-driven (if you like French wines, you'll hear this term a lot). Terroir is a concise way to define a specific region based upon the soil, climate, and the collective knowledge of the generations of people who have farmed the land.\n\nWhen shopping for Bordeaux reds, keep in mind, French wines are all about the region and the blend, not about individual grape varieties. In fact, you will rarely find blend percentages listed on the label.\n\nCollectively, Bordeaux produces 700 million bottles of wine in an average year! While some of the most expensive wines in the world come from Bordeaux, most are every day, affordable table wines.",

In addition to these fruit flavors, Tannat, when blended with other varieties, or produced in capable winemaking hands, tends to show off more complex notes of herbs, chocolate, leather, earth and minerals.\n\nWhile originally from the Basque region of France, Tannat was brought to Uruguay in the 1870s. It is now considered Uruguay's national red wine. Tannat is often blended with Pinot Noir, Merlot or other Bordeaux varieties, and sometimes with Syrah and Viognier.\n\nMost of the fine wines in Uruguay—including those made from Tannat—are produced in Canelones, which surrounds the capital of Montevideo on the southern Atlantic coast of the country.",

It has been flourishing madly since the 1960s, although it was first cultivated in the 1800s. \n\nCalifornian Cabernet Sauvignon is dry and full-bodied, and displays the grape's signature green flavors like bell pepper, dark fruits like blackberrry, with touches of eucalyptus and mint. These Cali versions tend to also show earth, dusty notes, mocha, and cedar. \n\nThe moderate to high tannin levels and concentrated flavors in Californian Cab make it a sensational food wine. It's superb with porterhouse steak, braised pork belly, hearty lamb stews, portobello mushrooms and grilled burgers.",
